# Project title

Automatically create user from xls document

## Getting Started

when a new name is added in the xls document found in ~src/utilisateur, the service will automatically check and create a user for you.

### Prerequisites

Clone the git repository onto your computer or download the zip file and extract it.


### Installing

You just need to execute the file install.sh into your terminal and the job is done with the code : ./install.sh

note:*Sometimes you need to give the file executable rights for it to be able to install on your pc, the code to fix that is :chmod +x install.sh*

The code will copy itself into your home ~/src to avoid conflits and issues.
